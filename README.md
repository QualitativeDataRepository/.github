### Hi 👋
The [Qualitative Data Repository (QDR)](https://qdr.syr.edu/) serves qualitative and mixed methods researchers by providing tools, platforms, and methods for reliably sharing rearch data. This github organization is where we...

- 💾 maintain the core infrastructure that runs QDR
- 🤝 collaborate with open-source projects, including our good friends at [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/)
- 👨🏻‍🍳 develop and host open-source tools like [AnnoRep](https://github.com/QualitativeDataRepository/AnnoREP-Frontend), and [AwardFindR](https://docs.ropensci.org/awardFindR/) 
- 🏗 build reproducable workflows for curating and publishing research data collections with [DV Curator](https://github.com/QualitativeDataRepository/dvcurator) and [ArchivR](https://github.com/QualitativeDataRepository/archivr)
- 📍 Our [technical roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/QualitativeDataRepository/projects/1) is public and updated bi-monthly

If you need to report a bug, ask a question, or just want to chat about research infrastructure, we would love to hear from you!
